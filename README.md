# typescript-express-api

A very basic, well commented, typescript, express, mongo app with tests using mocha and chai.

Use this as a simple API

First run a brew update
brew install mongodb
sudo mkdir /data
sudo chown iconnor /data
mkdir /data/db
mongod to start the mongo instance

This app uses a database called heros - change this in the config/database.ts file

npm install
gulp to build the dist
npm start to start the app
npm test to test the app
